## 🧠 Key Learnings

### What Worked

1. **Cluster Detection** - Following the 5-wallet Eagles cluster returned +$1,191
2. **Prop Bets** - Low entry price props (Barkley 1st TD at 12¢) had massive upside
3. **Cross-Platform Arb** - Captured $2,270 in risk-free profits
4. **Position Sizing** - 10% follow rate protected against whale losses

### What Didn't Work

1. **Following ALL whales** - Chiefs clusters lost money despite high confidence
2. **MVP Props** - 50% win rate but small profits vs losses
3. **AFC Championship** - Bills didn't make it past Chiefs

### Improvement Opportunities

1. **Sentiment Filter** - Weight clusters by social/news sentiment
2. **Outcome Correlation** - Reduce positions on correlated outcomes (Chiefs winner + 3-peat + Mahomes MVP)
3. **Dynamic Sizing** - Increase size for highest-confidence clusters

## 📈 Projected Annual Performance

Based on this 7-day sample (recognizing this was a high-activity period):

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Projected Monthly Returns (Conservative)"
    x-axis ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"]
    y-axis "Return %" 0 --> 100
    line [15, 25, 12, 10, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 18, 35, 20]
```

| Scenario | Weekly Return | Monthly | Annual |
|----------|---------------|---------|--------|
| Conservative | 5% | 20% | 240% |
| Moderate | 15% | 60% | 720% |
| This Week (actual) | 94% | 376% | 4,512% |

**Note:** Super Bowl week is abnormally high-volume. Expect lower returns during off-season months.
