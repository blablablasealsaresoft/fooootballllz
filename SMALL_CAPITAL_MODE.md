# 💰 SMALL CAPITAL MODE - $100 START

## ✅ YOUR SYSTEM IS NOW OPTIMIZED FOR $100!

I just reconfigured your entire system to work perfectly with just $100 starting capital!

---

## 🎯 **NEW SETTINGS (OPTIMIZED FOR $100)**

### **Capital Management**
```python
MAX_TRADING_CAPITAL = $100      # Total capital
MIN_USDC_RESERVE = $10          # Keep $10 in reserve
MAX_POSITION_SIZE_USD = $50     # Max $50 per trade
MAX_CONCURRENT_POSITIONS = 2    # Max 2 trades at once
```

### **Whale Detection (Adjusted)**
```python
MIN_WHALE_SIZE_USD = $5,000     # Track smaller whales
SNIPE_THRESHOLD_USD = $10,000   # Lower threshold
FOLLOW_PERCENTAGE = 1%          # Follow with 1% (not 10%)
```

### **Risk Management (Conservative)**
```python
MAX_DAILY_SNIPES = 5            # Max 5 trades per day
MAX_DAILY_LOSS_USD = $30        # Stop if lose $30 (30%)
STOP_LOSS_PCT = 15%             # Exit at -15%
TAKE_PROFIT_PCT = 50%           # Exit at +50%
```

## 📊 **HOW THIS WORKS WITH $100**

### **Example Scenario 1: Whale Follow**
```
Whale trades: $15,000 on Chiefs
Your follow: 1% of $15K = $150
System caps at: $50 (your max per trade)

Result: You buy $50 of Chiefs
Capital used: 50% of your $100
```

### **Example Scenario 2: Value Play**
```
Sportsbook shows: Patriots 65% likely
Polymarket shows: Patriots @ 0.50 (50%)
Value detected: 15% discrepancy

System buys: $50 of Patriots
Capital used: 50% of your $100
```

### **Example Scenario 3: Multiple Positions**
```
Position 1: $50 on Chiefs (from whale follow)
Position 2: $40 on Patriots (from value play)
Total deployed: $90 of $100
Reserve kept: $10 (safety)
```

---

## 🛡️ **SAFETY WITH SMALL CAPITAL**

### **Daily Loss Protection**
```
Starting capital: $100
Max daily loss: $30
Worst case: End day with $70
Stop trading before losing more
```

### **Position Sizing**
```
Max per trade: $50
Max concurrent: 2 positions
Max deployed: $90 (keep $10 reserve)

Can't overextend!
```

### **Trade Frequency**
```
Max trades: 5 per day
Prevents: Overtrading
Ensures: Quality over quantity
```

Balance: $142.50
```

### **Average Days**

```

### **Whale Snipe $25K+**

```

### **All Other Playbooks**

Now: $50 max per trade (capped)

System respects MAX_POSITION_SIZE_USD!
```

## 💡 **STRATEGY WITH $100**

### **Focus on Quality**
```
✅ Only follow high-confidence whales (75%+)
✅ Only take value plays with 10%+ edge
✅ Max 2 positions at once
✅ Max 5 trades per day
✅ Stop at -$30 daily loss
```

### **Goal: Compound Profits**
```
Week 1: $100 → $120 (20% gain)
Week 2: $120 → $144 (20% gain)
Week 3: $144 → $173 (20% gain)
